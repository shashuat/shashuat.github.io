Hello! I'm a Master Student in Computer Science at Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France. I'm interested in Multimodal Machine Learning Models and also verification of neural networks.

I'm looking for an Internship for April to September 2025.

## Research Interests

- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Machine Learning Optimisation
- Verification of Neural Networks
- Privacy in AI

## Projects

### Ensemble Language Models for Event Detection
*Natural Language Processing, HuggingFace Transformers* [GitHub Repository]([https://github.com/shashuat/](https://github.com/shashuat/EnsLM))
- Developed a classification model using text features extracted via ensemble knowledge distillation from Language models ranging from word vectors to LLMs. Stacked the text and Temporal features with meta-classifiers. Created a preprocessing pipeline and engineered features capturing semantic text insights.

### Multi Modal Transformer for Medical Visual Question Answering 
*Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shashuat/)

- Developed a Multimodal Transformer for Medical VQA, integrating BERT Language Model and Vision Transformer for image feature extraction. The architecture enhances medical image and text semantic representations through Masked Language Modeling with image features as a pretext task. Finetuned on the VQA-Med dataset achieving state-of-the-art results with 83.1% best modality accuracy.

### Voxtalum: AI Voice Assistant
*Langchain, DeepLake, Streamlit, Natural Language Processing* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shashuat/Voxtalum)

- Developed a dual-input approach for the AI voice assistant using Whisper and Langchain, enabling efficient knowledge retrieval and natural user interactions. Created a vector database using DeepLake for integrating the scraped knowledge base with BeautifulSoup4. Implemented a Streamlit app for easy user interactions.

### Quantum Enhanced Transformer
*PyTorch, Transformer Networks* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shashuat/Quantum-Enhanced-Transformer)

- Developed Quantum-enhanced transformer model leveraging PennyLane for quantum computations, featuring quantum multi-head attention and feed-forward networks for improved information processing, attaining 7% higher text classification accuracy at the same number of training steps.

## Research Experience

### Research Assistant
**Laboratoire d'Informatique (LIX), École Polytechnique** *Present*

- Exploring Machine Unlearning on Fine-Tuned LLMs i.e. Implementing selective forgetting techniques while maintaining model performance
- Experimenting with PEFT methods and various unlearning approaches

### Machine Learning Research Programmer
**Computing AI and Deep Learning Lab (HecAI), SMVDU** *May 2022 – May 2024*

- Designed a system for live transcription and summarization using transformer models, reducing the word error rate by 8% through fine-tuning a multilingual speech recognition model
- Achieved state-of-the-art results in detecting cervical cancer, brain tumors, and skin diseases by improving accuracy by 5-10% through feature selection with Nature-inspired Algorithms
- Researched deep learning and transfer learning, integrating pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet, and BERT

## Industrial Experience

### Data Scientist Internship
**SkilloVilla** *Sep 2023 - Dec 2023*
