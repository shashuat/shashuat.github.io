## Projects
### Multi Modal Transformer for Medical Visual Question Answering 
*Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision*  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shashuat/)

- Developed a Multimodal Transformer for Medical VQA, integrating the BERT Language Model and Vision Transformer for image feature extraction. 
- The architecture enhances medical image and text semantic representations through Masked Language Modeling with image features as a pretext task. 
- Fine-tuned on the VQA-Med dataset, the model optimizes attention mechanisms for precise image region analysis, achieving state-of-the-art results with 83.1% modality accuracy.

### Voxtalum: AI Voice Assistant(https://github.com/shashuat/Voxtalum) 
*Langchain, DeepLake, Streamlit, Natural Language Processing*  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shashuat/Voxtalum)

- Developed a dual-input approach for the AI voice assistant using Whisper and Langchain, enabling efficient knowledge retrieval and natural user interactions. 
- Created a vector database using DeepLake for integrating the scraped knowledge base with BeautifulSoup4. 
- Implemented a Streamlit app for easy user interactions.


## Work Experience
### Machine Learning Research Programmer
**Computing AI and Deep Learning Lab - SMVDU**  *May 2022 â€“ May 2024*

- Designed a system for live transcription and summarization using transformer models, reducing the word error rate by 8% through fine-tuning a multilingual speech recognition model. Utilized the Hugging Face ecosystem for training and sharing models and datasets. Developed demos for the voice model.
  
- Achieved state-of-the-art results in detecting cervical cancer, brain tumors, and skin diseases by improving accuracy by 5-10% through feature selection with Nature-inspired Algorithms like Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). Implemented advanced ensembling techniques and image segmentation using U-Net. Co-authored a patent and three research papers based on this work.
  
- Researched deep learning and transfer learning, integrating pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet, and BERT to improve model performance. Also explored audio generation techniques, including AudioLM. Led the development of the lab's website using Next.js.

### Associate Data Scientist
**SkilloVilla** *Sep 2023 - Dec 2023*

- Created Jupyter Notebooks to improve the data science curriculum, leading to a 20% boost in feedback scores. 
- Worked with industry experts to design masterclasses that included real-world examples of various ML models. 
- Built an automated scoring system for Python lab tests to streamline feedback.
